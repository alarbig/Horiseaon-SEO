## Description

This project was created as way to identify redundancy and clean up pre-existing code with HTML and CSS. 

As part of my learning process this was a way to better understand how code falls in line and how to make sure it is easier to read for the next person. 

I learned quite a bit about this. Not just the technical but also when to walk away and come back with a clean mind. I took a break for a day after hitting a brick wall and came back with a clear head, and I was able to identify more issues I had missed before.
