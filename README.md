# Horiseon SEO webpage

## Description

This project was created as way to identify redundancy and clean up pre-existing code with HTML and CSS. 

As part of my learning process this was a way to better understand how code falls in line and how to make sure it is easier to read for the next person. 

I learned quite a bit about this. Not just the technical but also when to walk away and come back with a clean mind. I took a break for a day after hitting a brick wall and came back with a clear head, and I was able to identify more issues I had missed before. 



## Installation

Since this is a simple webpage it will be hosted in the Github pages section and there is nothing to install. 

## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```


## License

The last section of a high-quality README file is the license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, refer to [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/).
